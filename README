slock - simple screen locker
============================
simple screen locker utility for X.


Customization of this fork
--------------------------
Just change the INIT color in config.def.h as the default black
background is hard to distinguish with poweroff/suspend/hibernate
screen. By the way, change the group `nogroup` to `nobody` since
there isn't such group on my machine.


Requirements
------------
In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
